## Summary
[G.O.A.T.](www.datafuture.me) multifunctional website that uses player performance data and twitter information to estimate their market value for the current season (19/20) in European leagues. 

## Context and Use case
Football is the most popular sport in the world. In 2019, clubs around the world completed 18,042 international transfers. The total value of international transfers reached USD 7.35 billion. From a managerial perspective, the most important decisions that team managers make concern player transfers, which is related to player's markte value. It plays an important role in the transfer negotiations. These values have traditionally been estimated by football experts. This product provides a data driven solution for forcasting player's market value so that team managers can make better decisions when signing new players.

## Data Collection
Data is collected by web scraping from [transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/):

- transfermarkt: player performance data
- twitter: tweets of hashtags of each player's name

I used Python request, BeautifulSoup, selenium, and json libraries to scrape and parse the html and json data.

European and and South American players are more popular in social media.

### Data Processing
- Selected players performance data such as number of matches played, number of goals and assists, position, injury, contract length, etc.
- Cleaned the tweets, including removing links, punctuation and stopwords, as well as lemmatization
- Obtained the sentiment score of each player based on the tweets. Built a TF-IDF matrix with all tweets and extracted a few columns, which represent words such 'good', 'great', 'goal', etc. 

## Models
Random forrest regressions were used to predict players' market value. Datasets were split 80% and 20% into train and test datasets respectively. Hyperparameter tuning was performed where a random search was first initiated. With the random search results, a grid search was performed with 3-fold cross validation to obtain the optimized paramaters for the model. Evaluations of the model performances were subsequently performed on the test dataset using several metrics including mean squared error, mean absolute error and R2.


## Web Application
A web app was built with Flask and hosted on AWS that allows users to predict delays based on their date and time of travel in downtown Toronto. A map with travel times in different segments of the city is displayed. Click [here](www.datafuture.me) to access the Webapp.
